The automation has been designed with TestNG and Selenium. TestNG is used to execute the test cases whereas Selenium is used to interact with the UI. The starting point is the build.xml which has two ant build targets “run-regression-chrome” and “run-regression-firefox” named after the respective browsers. All the needed JARs are packaged under the lib folder. The TestNG test suites are packaged under the configuration folder. When one of the above ant targets is executed, the corresponding TestNG suite file is executed which then runs the test cases present in the src folder using the properties file in the same src folder. (This file contains strings for the en-US locale. For other locales, new properties files need to be added as desired).
